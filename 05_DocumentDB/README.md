# Community Content - Azure DocumentDB

This folder contains content introducing Azure DocumentDB and demonstrating how to create DocumentDB databases and connect them to Azure Search. The content is divided into two sessions:

- Session 1 - Slides
- Session 2 - Using Azure DocumentDB (HOL)

The HOL may be presented as a hands-on lab or as a demo accompanying the slide deck.
